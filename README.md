## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to refactor the HTML/CSS code to make it be more accessible and condensed. -The improved code does this by changing some classes, ID's, consolidating CSS selectors, properties. -Including a more descriptive page title. -Adding more semantic code. -Adding elements to follow more logical HTML structure. -Including comments in the refractored/changed code structure. -Added accessibility to icons/images for disabled. -Reviewed heading, they were all appropriate.

## What I learned
Through this project I learned:

How to better manuever around web dev tools.
The difference between semantic and non-semantic taging.
How to manage Git and github to work locally and remotely.
The difference between class and ID's in CSS
How to add comments in HTML/CSS.
How to add more accessiblity to a web page.
Problems I encountered
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:

 Attempting to change a tag, element and having the page crash.
Difficulty consolidating css elements.
Wondering why they have asked me to change headings as they looked appropriate in size?
Losing some of the page detail in background and not figuring out how I did it.
